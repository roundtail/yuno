1.  You start with basic statistics, get to know the basic stuffs like mean, median, r square, then move deeper into statistical test. You get to understand, what is a statistical test, the kind of tests and when should you use them.
2.  You conduct statistical test on small data set, say, a data set of 1 variable with 20 observations. You get some good grasp of how to do the thing by excel.
3.  The data set got bigger, from 1 variable to 10 variables, from 20 obs to 20000, it became harder to use excel, so you use R. You redid everything you did in excel, except that itâ€™s in R. Remember, R is a tool.
4.  Structured data can no longer satisfy you, you tried moving to unstructured data, you realized that cleaning data is such a pain, and your limited programming expertise is the ass.
5.  You realized that R was built for statistical purpose, and that using R to do data manipulation can be a pain, you started wondering, if you should get another programming language.
6.  You got python, and it was worth it, every second of it. In the progress, you also picked up a query language.
7.  You want to better predict things, so you start exploring your options with machine learning, you get to understand the theory, as well as how to implement them. You understand that data structure and algorithms are important, and you could never get this far, without fighting your way through it.
8.  Random or unclear business problem no longer interested you, you start wanting to do things that bring back real benefit. You picked an industry of choice, and realized just how lacking you are, in term of domain knowledge.
